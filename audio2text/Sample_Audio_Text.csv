2023-10-21,audiofile82.mp3,"Welcome to AutoAssure Insurance, this is Emma speaking. How may I help? Hi Emma, I’m Carl. I received a notice that my premium has gone up, and I don't agree with the reasons given. I want to speak with a supervisor. I'm sorry to hear that, Carl. Let me review your policy details. Your premium increase is due to a change in the regional risk assessment. I can look into discounts that might help offset this increase before I transfer you to a supervisor. I'd rather just speak to a supervisor, Emma. I understand, Carl, but if I may, I can quickly check for any applicable discounts and this might resolve your issue faster. Okay, fine, but make it quick, Emma. Thanks for giving me the opportunity, Carl. I found a safe driver discount that you qualify for, which will reduce your premium. How does that sound? That actually helps. Thanks, Emma. My pleasure, Carl. Anything else I can help with? No, that's all.
